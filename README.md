# CssCreature
I have created a creature using HTML and CSS. This exercise is intended to help me elaborate on how to use CSS to construct images and it was so much fun! 
This is the 1.0 version. Going forward I will incorporate JavaScript to add a lot of interaction with a user! Thank you for checling out my repo!
